# Library Inventory System

An inventory system for managing books, authors, etc built using 
Django, PostgreSQL, and hosted on [Railway](https://web-production-5343.up.railway.app/).

Very basic, this is a starting point for other interesting Django/Full
Stack projects.

Developed following the [Mozilla Django Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django).
